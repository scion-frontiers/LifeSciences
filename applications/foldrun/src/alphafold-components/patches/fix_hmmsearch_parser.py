"""Patch AF2 parsers.py to skip unparseable template descriptions instead of crashing.

Some PDB entries (e.g. 5apu) have description formats that don't match the
expected regex in _parse_hmmsearch_description, causing ValueError and
pipeline failure. This patch wraps the call in try/except so the parser
logs a warning and skips the bad entry instead of crashing.

Applied at container build time via Dockerfile.
